# lang-scala

This is a [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) language plug-in for the [Sugar\*
framework](https://github.com/sugar-lang/-main-).
Please refer to [sugarj.org](http://sugar.org) for more information on the
framework.

## Requirements

The plug-in expects the `scalac` script from the Scala distribution to be
accessible in a command line call.
For this purpose please make sure that the Scala distribution is installed on
your system and the `PATH` environment variable is set correctly inside
Eclipse.
